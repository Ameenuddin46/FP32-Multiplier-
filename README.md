# BF16-Multiplier-

For algorithm modelling and simulation, floating-point is the most preferred data type to provide highly accurate calculations. 
Although their operations are crucial for calculations with a wide dynamic range, they use a lot more resources than integer operations. 
Due to its excellent programmability and flexibility, FPGA has experienced significant market growth. 
Due to the quick development of FPGA technology, such devices are becoming more and more desirable for the implementation of floating-point arithmetic. 
Reprogrammable FPGAs give them flexibility for quick prototyping. They can be set up for Application Specific Integrated Circuit after prototyping is finished. 
The HDL language Verilog was used to build algorithms for 16-BIT Brain floating point operations based on IEEE - 754. 
All cases, including exceptions, were tested using test vectors.

#Brain Float 16

The significance of 16-bit floating-point numbers, also referred to as float16, is mostly due to how effectively they use memory and accelerate computation. Memory economy is crucial in many computational applications, particularly those involving huge datasets and complicated algorithms. Since Float16 data types only need half as much memory as their 32-bit equivalents, they are extremely useful in applications where memory is at a premium, like embedded systems or mobile devices. Additionally, the smaller memory footprint enables faster data transfer and more effective data storage, which significantly boosts processing performance overall. This benefit is especially important in the field of deep learning and neural networks, which handle enormous volumes of data concurrently. There are numerous contemporary deep learning frameworks and specialised devices, like GPUs,
